      // Simplifying overly specific redirects can be done in two ways:
      //
      // -------
      //
      // Problem: The redirect is a superset of the current cache contexts.
      // Solution: We replace the redirect with the current contexts.

      // Example: Suppose we try to store an object with context A, whereas we
      // already have a redirect that uses A and B. In this case we simply store
      // the object at the address designated by context A and next time someone
      // tries to load the initial AB object, it will restore its redirect path
      // by adding an AB redirect step after A.
      //
      // -------
      //
      // Problem: The redirect overlaps, with both options having unique values.
      // Solution: Find the common contexts and use those for a new redirect.
      //
      // Example: Suppose we try to store an object with contexts A and C, but
      // we already have a redirect that uses A and B. In this case we find A to
      // be the common cache context and replace the redirect with one only
      // using A, immediately followed by one for AC so there is a full path to
      // the data we're trying to set. Next time someone tries to load the
      // initial AB object, it will restore its redirect path by adding an AB
      // redirect step after A.

            $common_contexts = array_intersect($result_contexts, $contexts);

            // If the only common contexts are those we've seen before, it means
            // we are trying to set a redirect at an address that is completely
            // different from the one that was already there. This cannot be
            // allowed as it completely breaks the redirect system.
            //
            // Example: The value for context A is 'foo' and we are trying to
            // store a redirect with AB at A:foo. Then, for a different value of
            // B, we are trying to store a redirect at A:foo with AC. This makes
            // no sense as there would now no longer be a way to find the first
            // item that triggered the initial redirect.
            //
            // This usually occurs when using calculated cache contexts and the
            // author tried to manually optimize them. E.g.: When using
            // user.roles:anonymous and in one of the outcomes we end up varying
            // by user.roles. In that case, both user.roles:anonymous and
            // user.roles need to be present on the cacheable metadata, even
            // though they will eventually be optimized into user.roles. The
            // cache needs all the initial information to do its job and if an
            // author were to manually optimize this prematurely, it would be
            // impossible to properly store a redirect chain.
            //
            // Another way this might happen is if a new object that can specify
            // cacheable metadata is instantiated without inheriting the cache
            // contexts of all the logic that happened up until that point. A
            // common example of this is when people immediately return the
            // result of one of the factory methods on AccessResult, without
